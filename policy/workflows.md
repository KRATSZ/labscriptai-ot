# Workflow sequences (canonical)

This file is the **single source of truth** for end-to-end and tool-order workflows. Other docs (root `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, lightweight compatibility stubs, skill files) should link here instead of copying full sequences.

## New experiment (end-to-end)

```
user intent / SOP
  →  (optional) one blocking clarification round
  →  protocol-author draft
  →  doctor_local_runtime → simulate_protocol → parse_simulation_output
  →  (fix loop if failed)
  →  live_readiness_check (robot_ip, session_id?, file_path?) when the operator wants a read-only live gate
  →  return status: ready | needs_confirmation | blocked
  →  run_protocol (robot_ip, file_path, session_id) only after confirmation
```

## Protocol validation only (no live robot)

```
doctor_local_runtime → simulate_protocol → parse_simulation_output
```
Script equivalent: `verify_protocol.py doctor` then `verify_protocol.py analyze <file>`.

Before simulating a new draft, it is worth calling `validate_labware_name` on unfamiliar load names, `inspect_labware_definition` when geometry or dead volume matters, and `estimate_tip_budget` on the draft protocol source. Those checks catch the highest-frequency authoring mistakes before the slower sim step.
If the user only wants validation or labware inspection, stop after the check and report findings; do not fabricate a full `protocol.py`.

## User-facing defaults

- If code exists and is runnable, simulate is the default next action.
- Ask at most one clarification round before drafting.
- Only block on missing information that would change safety, deck truth, robot compatibility, or module choice.

## Error recovery (live robot)

```
parse_error (robot_ip, run_id) → suggest_recovery_action (error_category, target_slot)
  → execute_protocol_recovery (run_id, robot_ip, recovery_branch, ...)
```

## Live readiness gate (read-only)

```
health_check
  → live_readiness_check (robot_ip, session_id?, file_path?, run_id?)
  → if fail: stop and follow recommended_next_tools
  → if pass/warn: create_run or run_protocol only after operator confirmation
```

`health_check` is the developer/environment probe. `live_readiness_check` is the operator-facing live gate.

## After MCP restart or host reboot

```
safe_next_action (session_id, robot_ip?)   # same data as restart_review + recommended_next_tool / operator_steps
  OR restart_review (session_id, robot_ip?)
  → reconcile_state (if reconcile_first)
  → robot_status → module_status → is_home_safe (before any home)
```

`safe_next_action` is a thin wrapper: one call returns full `restart_review` data plus `safe_next_action.recommended_next_tool` (usually `reconcile_state` or `robot_status`) and numbered `operator_steps`. Atomic tools are unchanged.

## Check robot status (quick)

```
robot_status → module_status → reconcile_state (if anything looks wrong)
```

## Optional deck vision (observation-only)

Use this **only when the operator explicitly asks** for a visual deck check, camera preview, or image-based confirmation. Vision does **not** replace committed deck truth — compare results with **`reconcile_state`** and robot APIs (see `policy/safety-policy.md`).

**Setup (once per machine):**

- Python: `pip install ultralytics opencv-python-headless pillow` in `OPENTRONS_PYTHON` (see [GETTING_STARTED.md](../docs/GETTING_STARTED.md#deck-vision-setup)).
- Calibration: `python automation/click_deck_corners.py` → `automation/photo/deck_calibration.json` (auto-loaded by `vision_check`).
- Layout policy: `automation/deck_layout_policy.json` (fixed modules/trash + detection slots/classes).
- Weights: bundled `vision/models/weights/deck_v2_best.pt` or set `OPENTRONS_DECK_YOLO_WEIGHTS`.

**Tool sequence (MCP `opentrons-lab-mcp`):**

```
camera_status → capture_preview_image → vision_check (image_path = path returned by capture)
```

- If the camera API is unavailable on a given Flex build, `camera_status` / capture may fail — surface the error; do not silently skip.
- For offline validation without a robot, call `vision_check` with a local image path only (see checklist A in `docs/runbooks/vision-acceptance.md`).

## Protocol Reference Library

Default location: `bundled-library/` (L0 Flex templates plus curated L1 protocols). For the full 833-protocol catalog, set `OPENTRONS_PROTOCOL_LIBRARY_PATH`.

Always use catalog, never scan all folders:
- Search: `python skills/opentrons-protocol-library/scripts/search_protocols.py search "keywords"`
- Inspect: `python skills/opentrons-protocol-library/scripts/search_protocols.py show <slug>`
- Snippets: `python skills/opentrons-protocol-library/scripts/search_protocols.py snippet <slug> <keywords>`
- Rebuild curated bundle from the monorepo: `python scripts/build_curated_library.py`
